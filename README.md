# Morse-Code-Converter

A simple Python scripting project that allows you to convert English text into Morse Code and the other way around.

First, you will be asked to choose a mode by typing:
- 'M' to convert Morse Code to text,
- 'T' to convert text to Morse Code.

Rules and additional options:
- Double space indicates spaces between words in Morse Code, therefore
when converting Morse Code to a string you should use double space as a break between single words.
- To exit Morse Code Converter type '#'.
